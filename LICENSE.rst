 Additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public
 License, version 3 ("GPLv3"):

 If you convey this file as part of a work that contains a
 configuration script generated by Autoconf, you may do so under

 This clause has been written by FSF lawyers for Autotools.  If you have any
 concerns about legal issues, do not contact me as I Am Not A Lawyer.  I
 *think* you can get advices at <copyright-clerk at fsf dot org>.  The intent
 here is to keep the code Free but to allow anyone to *use* it.
