	* The expgram will concentrate on ngrams, not other stuff:
	    - Completely removed ICU and boost.regex
	    - Completely removed stemmer/speller

	* Added smooth_smallest to logprob(first, last) and logbound(first, last) when querying logprobabilities

	* Renamed ngram_counts/ngram_counts_mpi to ngram_counts_extract/ngram_counts_extract_mpi, respectively.
	
	* Faster ngram_counts_extract/ngram_counts_extract_mpi
	     - Use non-compact hash-table at root level.
	     - Vocab-mapping tweaking when dumping ngram-counts.

	* Added --filter to ngram_counts_extract/ngram_counts_extract_mpi in order to perform text filtering, such as tokenization.

	* Added ngram_stat/ngram_counts_stat to show some statiscs on indexed size.

	* Added ngram_perplexiy
	
	* Implemented "mpish", a tool to perform mapping of set of shell-command.
	  For instance, you can run:
	      for ((i=0;i<1024;++i)) do; echo "uname -a" done | mpirun --host <list-of-host-delimited-by-,> --np <#-of-processes> mpish 
	  This will run exact 1024 "uname -a" split on machines (indicated by --host), with  --np processees. The tasks are not evently split, but
	  perform simple scheduling.
