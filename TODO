* Test for MPI implementation!

* Implement ngram_counts_filter/ngram_counts_filter_mpi
    - perform ngram-counts filtering by its "unigram" freqency
    - Less-frequent words are mapped into <unk>, thus ngram-counts recomputation will be required.

* Implement --min-ngram to perform filtering duing indexing (for bigrams and upward)

* Implement mini-expgram, which supports only loading.
