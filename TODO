* Test for MPI implementation!

* Implement ngram_counts_filter/ngram_counts_filter_mpi
    - perform ngram-counts filtering by its freqency

* Implement ngram_perplexity (easy...)

* Implement mini-expgram, which supports only loading.

* Implement count thresholding during ngram counts indexing... How?
    -  via option? --min-unigram / --min-ngram
